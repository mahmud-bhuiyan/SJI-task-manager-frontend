# Task Management Frontend Documentation

Welcome to the Task Management Frontend documentation. This application is implemented using React.js, React Router and Tailwind CSS.

## Introduction

The Task Management App is a user-friendly tool designed to assist you in organizing and tracking tasks efficiently. It employs a tech stack comprising React.js for building interactive user interfaces, React Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Backend Integration
